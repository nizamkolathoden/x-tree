Christmas Tree
===============

I found animated Christmas tree on reddit:

Was curious to make it in js. Current results are here: [Happy new  2020!](https://hardcore-wing-20e2c8.netlify.app/). Wish you all great successes and joy, doing what you love!

How it's built?
---------------
The tree is built of two spirals. These [11 lines of code](https://github.com/anvaka/atree/blob/2937249242a0204929aca45cdb8b937cfb5af3e5/index.js#L86-L97) render one line on spiral. It includes 3d projection and background shadow. _Almost_ the same as this [wiki image](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ComplexSinInATimeAxe.gif):

It's almost perfect now
